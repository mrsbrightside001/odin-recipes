# odin-recipes

In this project, I want to build a website that showcases my favorite recipes from the web. The primary focus is baking. Also I want to roughly translate and add notes to the recipes on my website to accomodate the changes I have made to the original recipes. That includes translating cups and ounces to grams and milliliters as well as tips and tricks and notes on amounts.
